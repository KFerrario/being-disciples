## Chapter 1: Being Disciples

1. The poet David Jones wrote “It is easy to miss him at the turn of a civilization”. In a society that has abdicated “being” to a presence to technology, is it possible to be a disciple as “ a state of being”?

2. Discuss a time when you “saw” something as opposed to “noticing” it. Optional- discuss a moment when you missed a kingfisher - how did you rectify the moment or is it lost forever. 

3. Is expectancy and presence the same? Can expectancy be detrimental in the sense that it can lead to magical thinking? How do you balance the demands of secular and divine presence?

4. Rowan says that a virtue of being a disciple is: “Disciples are expectant in the sense that they take it for granted that there is always something about to break through from the Master, the Teacher, something about to burst through the ordinary and uncover a new light on the landscape. The Master is going to speak or show something; reality is going to open up when you are in the Master's company,… “ Mike Cooper, host of Christianity Today, said to Krista Tippett that people listening to his podcast have expressed “feeling to some extent spiritually and to a large extent politically homeless. Their options don’t represent them well."

Has the role of what it means to be a disciple changed- Have we moved from expectancy to survival? Does the idea of what faith is, represents and calls for change with a changing environment? How do we maintain a disciples “state of being” in a cultural setting that either opposes it or is indifferent to it?

5. Does discipleship, by its nature and Rowan’s definition, call us to reorganize how we see the world? We live in a global community where information is disseminated constantly and unvetted- most of it seemingly supporting various silo positions and instilling fear into the landscape. How do we grow in faith and understanding, based on Rowan’s principles of discipleship, and still be conscious of our secular world, and at the same time, not be consumed by it. 
6. How do we establish the power of tradition through stories, by what we have been, by who we are?

## Chapter 3: Forgiveness

1. Jesus compares giving bread versus a stone to illustrate God’s generosity (Matt. 7:7-9). Can you share a time in your life when you felt God provided for you in an unexpected way? How did that experience shape your understanding of forgiveness?
2. What are some personal obstacles you’ve faced when trying to forgive someone? How do you see these challenges addressed in the teachings shared in this chapter?
3. Rowan Williams emphasizes the idea of generosity being at the heart of forgiveness. Can you recall a moment when someone’s generosity changed your heart? How might that experience inform the way you approach forgiving others?
4. Rowan Williams offers Jesus as the ultimate model of forgiveness. How does reflecting on His example encourage or challenge you in your own relationships?
5. Have you ever witnessed or experienced a relationship restored through forgiveness? What role did faith or prayer play in that restoration?

## Chapter 4: Faithfulness

1. Faithfulness often requires commitment and trust. Can you share a story of a relationship—whether with God, family, or friends—where faithfulness was especially significant?
2. What are some of the most difficult areas in your life where you’ve had to remain faithful? How do you think this connects to the ideas presented in chapter four?
3. Rowan Williams talks about being fully present as an act of faithfulness. Can you recall a time when someone’s faithful presence made a difference in your life?
4. Reflecting on the concept of God’s unwavering faithfulness, how does that assurance influence your daily walk with Christ?
5. Can you share an example of someone in your life who lived out their faith in a way that inspired you? How did their faithfulness impact you?

## Chapter 6: Life in the Spirit

1. Rowan Williams talks about hearing our name spoken by God and asking Him, *“Tell me who I really am.”* Have you ever experienced a moment where you felt God reveal something about your identity or purpose? What was it like?

2. Dispassion involves stepping back from our emotions to gain perspective. Can you recall a time when you had to pause and reflect on your emotions before responding? What did you learn from that experience?

   #### Creating Space for Stillness

3. The chapter emphasizes stillness as essential for hearing God. What practical steps help you find stillness in the middle of a busy week? Can you share a specific habit or practice that’s worked for you?

4. Reflect on the phrase, *“Silence is the sacrament of the age to come.”* Have you ever experienced God’s presence in silence or stillness? How did it shape your faith?

   #### Anticipating Growth in Faith

5. Growth in the Spirit means being open to change and stretching beyond our comfort zones. When was the last time God stretched you spiritually? How did you respond, and what did you learn about yourself?

6. Williams describes growth as clearing clutter and creating space for God’s life. What “clutter” in your life feels like it’s holding you back from growing in your discipleship? How might God be inviting you to let it go?

   #### Joy as Overflow

7. Joy is described as boundary-breaking and overflowing. Have you ever experienced a moment of deep, uncontainable joy in your faith journey? What brought it on, and how did it impact your relationship with God or others?

8. Sometimes the church struggles with embracing joy. Have you ever felt hesitant to express joy in worship or your spiritual life? What might it look like for our group or community to embrace joy more fully?

   #### Practical Application

9. Galatians 5:22–23 lists the fruits of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Which of these fruits feels most abundant in your life right now? Which one do you feel called to cultivate more deeply?

10. Williams challenges us to be present in prayer, not distracted by anxieties or fantasies. What strategies or tools have helped you stay focused and present with God during prayer or worship?

11. Williams talks about finding freedom from projections and expectations. In your own discipleship journey, how have you balanced the expectations of others with the call to follow Christ authentically?

12. If joy is a marker of life in the Spirit, where have you seen this joy reflected in your daily interactions or in our group? How can we encourage each other to live in that joy more consistently?
